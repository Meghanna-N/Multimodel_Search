# Multimodel_Search
Multimodal search system where a text query retrieves relevant images, videos, and audio based on semantic meaning. Uses OpenAI CLIP to generate shared embeddings for text and visual data, and LanceDB for fast vector similarity search. Focuses on meaning-based retrieval instead of keyword matching.
